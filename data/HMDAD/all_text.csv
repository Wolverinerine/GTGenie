Collinsella aerofaciens,Colon cancer,"Some Lactobacillus species and Eubacterium aerofaciens, which also produces major amounts of lactic acid, showed closest associations with low risk of colon cancer."
Collinsella aerofaciens,Colon cancer,"Lactobacillus S06 and Eubacterium aerofaciens were significantly associated with a low risk of colon cancer, and total lactobacillus concentrations also were inversely related to risk."
Collinsella aerofaciens,Colon cancer,The incidence of Eubacterium aerofaciens showed an inverse relationship with risk of colon cancer among all of the populations tested.
Collinsella aerofaciens,Colon cancer,"Currently, there is no indication that the lactic acid bacteria, including Eubacterium aerofaciens, have any protective effect against colon cancer."
Fusobacterium,Periodontal,"The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusohaderium nucleatum/periodoniicum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia. Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptucoccus micros."
Porphyromonas gingivalis,Periodontal,One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus. Porphvromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticoht. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
Prevotella,Periodontal,"The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusohaderium nucleatum/periodoniicum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia. Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptucoccus micros."
Prevotella,Periodontal,"however, many of the most ribosome-rich microbes in disease samples were those previously associated with infection, including Tannerella sp., Prevotella sp., Treponema sp., and Porphyromonas sp."
Prevotella,Periodontal,"In patient 1, Tannerella forsythia is the major source of collagenase expression, whereas collagenase expression is augmented by Prevotella tannerae in patient 2 and by Porphyromonas gingivalis in patient 3."
Treponema,Periodontal,One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus. Porphvromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticoht. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
Treponema,Periodontal,"however, many of the most ribosome-rich microbes in disease samples were those previously associated with infection, including Tannerella sp., Prevotella sp., Treponema sp., and Porphyromonas sp."
Helicobacter pylori,Gastric and duodenal ulcer,"Both types of peptic ulcer showed a significant decline in their hospitalisation rates between 1970 and 1995, the decline being far more pronounced in duodenal than gastric ulcer (fig 2). In the veterans population, the hospitalisation rates for gastric and duodenal ulcer were similar among whites and non-whites. In striking contrast with the behaviour of peptic ulcer"
Helicobacter pylori,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,The ethnic variations and the opposing time trends of gastroduodenal versus oesophageal disease are consistent with the hypothesis that the declining infection rates of H pylori in the general population have led to a rise in the occurrence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and associated oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
Helicobacter pylori,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,"This process appears to be partially reversible, as eradication of H pylori in order to cure peptic ulcer disease can result in new onset of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)."
Staphylococcus aureus,Guttate psoriasis,The best known casesare induction of guttate psoriasis following a streptococcalthroat infection and aggravation of atopic dermatitisfollowing colonization with Staphylococcus aureus
Clostridia,Atopy,"By using fluorescence in situ hydridization, atopic subjects had more clostridia in their stools than nonatopic subjects, resulting in a reduced ratio of bifidobacteria to clostridia."
Clostridia,Atopy,The results demonstrated that the ratio of bifidobacteria to clostridia was reduced in atopic subjects.
Clostridia,Atopy,The difference was caused by a tendency toward lower counts of bifidobacteria and higher counts of clostridia in atopic subjects.
Clostridia,Atopy,The data obtained here demonstrate for the first time that differences in gut microflora precede the development of atopy and characterize the difference as a reduced ratio of bifidobacteria to clostridia at neonatal age.

Clostridium coccoides,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),Average results from three fecal samples suggested differences in the Clostridium coccoides subgroup and Bifidobacterium catenulatum group between IBS patients (n = 21) and controls (n = 15). 
Clostridium coccoides,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),"Of the intestinal pathogens earlier associated with IBS, no indications of Helicobacter spp. or Clostridium difficile were found whereas one case of Campylobacter jejuni was identified by sequencing."
Desulfovibrio,Diarrhea Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),the diarrhea predominant IBS patients seemed to have lower amounts of Desulfovibrio
Ruminococcus productus,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),"Ruminococcus productus DSM 2950, and Veillonella parvula ATCC 10790 were used as positive and negative controls in real-time PCR."

Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"However, compared with lean mice and regardless of kinship, ob/ob animals have a 50% reduction in the abundance of Bacteroidetes and a proportional increase in Firmicutes. These changes, which are division-wide, indicate that, in this model, obesity affects the diversity of the gut microbiota and suggest that intentional manipulation of community structure may be useful for regulating energy balance in obese individuals."
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,Obesity Correlates with a Shift in the Abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"The cecal microbiota of obese mice had a statistically significant 50% reduction in Bacteroidetes, relative to lean mice, and a significantly greater proportion of Firmicutes"
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"Here we show that the relative proportion of Bacteroidetes is decreased in obese people by comparison with lean people, and that this proportion increases with weight loss on two types of low-calorie diet."
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"mice that are genetically obese (ob/ob) have 50% fewer Bacteroidetes, and correspondingly more Firmicutes, than their lean (+/+) siblings"
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"Before diet therapy, obese people had fewer Bacteroidetes (P<0.001) and more Firmicutes (P=0.002) than did lean controls"
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,The most abundant bacterial groups in faeces of lean and obese subjects belonged to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes changed in favor of the Bacteroidetes in overweight (P = 0.001) and obese subjects (P = 0.005). 
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"Recently, it has been hypothesised that an increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes may make a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of obesity."
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,By comparison with wild-type animals Ley and co-workers demonstrated that genetically obese (ob/ob) mice show an increased proportion of the Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"In turn, the median proportion of the bacterial division Bacteroidetes of the total sum of species studied was higher in overweight (46.8%, P = 0.001) and obese (45.0%, P = 0.006), respectively, than in lean volunteers (22.9%), since the Bacteroidetes count remained largely unaffected by BMI. "
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"On the whole, this led to a lower ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in overweight (P = 0.001) and obese volunteers (P = 0.005). "
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,It has been assumed that the proportional representation of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes may play a role in the development of obesity
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,It is worthy of mention that the proportion of Bacteroidetes significantly increased in overweight and obese subjects.
Bacteroidetes,Obesity,"Interestingly, the reduction of Bacteroidetes and bifidobacteria has an influence on obesity"
Firmicutes,Obesity,Obesity Correlates with a Shift in the Abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.

Firmicutes,Obesity,"Before diet therapy, obese people had fewer Bacteroidetes (P<0.001) and more Firmicutes (P=0.002) than did lean controls"
Firmicutes,Obesity,"Significant diet-dependent reductions in a group of butyrate-producing Firmicutes were, however, detected in fecal samples from obese subjects on weight loss diets."
Firmicutes,Obesity,"Diets designed to achieve weight loss in obese subjects can significantly alter the species composition of the gut microbiota, but we find no evidence that the proportions of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes among fecal bacteria have a function in human obesity."
Firmicutes,Obesity,"It has been reported, on the basis of evidence from 16S rRNA sequencing, that the proportions of the two major bacterial phyla found in the human fecal microbiota, the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes, differ between obese and lean humans,6 with the suggestion that the colonic microbiota found in obese subjects is more efficient than that of lean subjects at recovering energy from resistant dietary components."
Firmicutes,Obesity,"Previous reports also indicate an increase in the proportion of Firmicutes present in the feces or colon of obese human subjects and ob/ob mice,7, 8 as compared with lean controls."
Firmicutes,Obesity,"Our findings therefore do not support the hypothesis that the proportions of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, at least at the phylum level, have a major function in determining human obesity."
Firmicutes,Obesity,"Our results extend the findings of others by demonstrating that obese individuals harbor unique H2-producing bacterial groups, particularly members of the Prevotellaceae family and certain groups within Firmicutes."
Firmicutes,Obesity,The most abundant bacterial groups in faeces of lean and obese subjects belonged to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.

Bacteroides fragilis,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),Specific probes against the three major bacterial groups (table 1) revealed a significant relative reduction in the Clostridium leptum group in CD patients compared with healthy subjects (p<0.02) whereas the proportions of Clostridium coccoides and Bacteroides groups were similar in the two groups of subjects
Clostridium coccoides,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),Specific probes against the three major bacterial groups (table 1) revealed a significant relative reduction in the Clostridium leptum group in CD patients compared with healthy subjects (p<0.02) whereas the proportions of Clostridium coccoides and Bacteroides groups were similar in the two groups of subjects
Clostridium coccoides,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),"A previous analysis of amplified and cloned rRNA gene libraries from healthy volunteers (n = 3) and CD patients (n = 3)23 also indicated that the Firmicutes (Clostridium leptum and Clostridium coccoides groups) had significantly lesser complexity in CD (25 v 73 OTUs) (Irène Mangin, personal communication).

Clostridium leptum,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),"The results obtained by FISH and the metagenomic approach were highly consistent, showing a marked reduction in the number of active cells and in the diversity of the Clostridium leptum group in patients with CD."
Clostridium leptum,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),"Healthy subjects and CD patients were compared using the Student’s t test for two independent sets of samples. *p<0.02, significant difference between healthy subjects and CD patients for the Clostridium leptum group."
Clostridium leptum,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),"In particular, the Clostridium leptum phylogenetic group was significantly less abundant in CD patients than in healthy subjects."
Prevotella,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),"The total number of Bacteroidetes OTUs was similar in the two groups, while differences in the Prevotella and Bacteroides fragilis subgroups were found."
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacterium-specific PCR assays showed that atopobium species, megasphaera species, and an eggerthella-like uncultured bacterium were detected in a high percentage of subjects with bacterial vaginosis, and these assays had moderate specificity for bacterial vaginosis."
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Thus, BVAB1, BAVB2, and BVAB3 have distinct morphologic features; are easily distinguished from other bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis, such as atopobium, mobiluncus, and gardnerella species; and are found attached to vaginal epithelial cells in a way that is typical of the clue cells that characterize bacterial vaginosis."
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Atopobium, leptotrichia, megasphaera, and eggerthella-like bacterial species were found in a high percentage of subjects who had bacterial vaginosis, according to bacterium-specific PCR."
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"The presence of atopobium was less specific for bacterial vaginosis than was the presence of BVAB1, BVAB2, or BVAB3."
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Although no single bacterium could be identified as a specific marker for healthy over diseased conditions, three phyla - Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria, and eight genera including Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter were strongly associated with BV (p < 0.05)."
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Leptotrichia/Sneathia and Prevotella were more common and present at a higher copy numbers in the BV group, although there were significant interpersonal variations (data not shown)"
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"In our study, eight BV-related genera, i.e., Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter, were detected at higher prevalence and higher relative abundance in women with BV."
Atopobium,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Another genus in Actinobacteria, Atopobium, which plays an important role in the development of BV and treatment failure, is highly abundant in the vaginal microbiota of BV"
Atopobium vaginae,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacteria frequently detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis included Atopobium vaginae, two megasphaera species, two distinct dialister phylotypes, Leptotrichia amnionii and the related bacterium Sneathia sanguinegens, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, and a bacterium distantly related to Eggerthella hongkongensis (92 percent sequence similarity). "
Atopobium vaginae,Bacterial Vaginosis,Several groups have detected A. vaginae 16S rDNA in vaginal fluid from subjects with bacterial vaginosis and have suggested a role of this bacterium in bacterial vaginosis
Atopobium vaginae,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Previous studies have demonstrated that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome, characterized by a shift in vaginal microbiota from a predominant population of Lactobacillus spp. [14, 32] to their gradual or total replacement with anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis[33], Morbiluncus spp. [34], Prevotella spp. [14], Mycoplasma hominis[21] and the recently identified metronidazole resistant Atopobium vaginae[35]. These species are however also found in subjects who do not suffer from BV with low copy numbers and thus cannot be used as a specific marker for disease."
Atopobium vaginae,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Our results also confirmed this implication. Eggerthella, like A. vaginae in this phylum, was strongly correlated with BV."
Clostridiales,Bacterial Vaginosis,We identified three bacterial species in the Clostridiales order that were highly specific for the presence of bacterial vaginosis and only distantly related to known bacteria.
Clostridiales,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Women with bacterial vaginosis have complex vaginal infections with many newly recognized species, including three bacteria in the Clostridiales order that were highly specific for bacterial vaginosis."
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacterium-specific PCR assays showed that atopobium species, megasphaera species, and an eggerthella-like uncultured bacterium were detected in a high percentage of subjects with bacterial vaginosis, and these assays had moderate specificity for bacterial vaginosis."
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacteria frequently detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis included Atopobium vaginae, two megasphaera species, two distinct dialister phylotypes, Leptotrichia amnionii and the related bacterium Sneathia sanguinegens, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, and a bacterium distantly related to Eggerthella hongkongensis (92 percent sequence similarity).

Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Atopobium, leptotrichia, megasphaera, and eggerthella-like bacterial species were found in a high percentage of subjects who had bacterial vaginosis, according to bacterium-specific PCR."
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria, and eight genera including Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter were strongly associated with BV (p < 0.05). "

Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,Tamrakar et al. (2007) reported that the presence of Eggerthella was an independent risk factor of BV scores (Nugent score ≥ 7)
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,Leptotrichia amnionii and Eggerthella sp. were the only two BV-associated bacteria (BVABs) significantly associated with each of the four Amsel’s criteria.
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacteria that were present in greater than 75% of women and significantly associated with BV included A. vaginae (92%), Eggerthella-like (85.5%), L. amnionii (78%), Aerococcus christensenii (79%), Dialister micraerophilus (79%) and Prevotella timonensis (75%)"
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,Eggerthella and L. amnionii were the only BV-associated bacteria that were positively associated with all four clinical criteria.
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Only two bacteria, Leptotrichia amnionii and Eggerthella sp., were associated with each of the 4 clinical criteria for BV, though many taxa were significantly correlated with BV overall."
Eggerthella,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacteria present in significant numbers in women with BV included A. vaginae (92%), L. iners (86%) and Eggerthella species (85%)."
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Several bacteria have been implicated in bacterial vaginosis, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus curtisii, but these species are also found in subjects who do not have bacterial vaginosis and thus are not specific markers for disease."
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Koch's postulates for establishing disease causation have not been fulfilled for any bacterium or group of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis. The disorder responds to treatment with antibiotics such as metronidazole and clindamycin, but metronidazole has a low level of activity in vitro against G. vaginalis and M. curtisii. Relapse and persistence are common."
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,L. iners was detected in most subjects. G. vaginalis was detected in all bacterial-vaginosis clone libraries and M. mulieris in one library.
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Although G. vaginalis was present in all subjects with bacterial vaginosis according to bacterium-specific PCR, it was also found in 59 percent of subjects without bacterial vaginosis."
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,"No single bacterium has been shown to cause the disease, and many cultivated bacteria linked to bacterial vaginosis, such as G. vaginalis, frequently colonize the vagina of women without bacterial vaginosis."
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Previous studies have demonstrated that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome, characterized by a shift in vaginal microbiota from a predominant population of Lactobacillus spp. [14, 32] to their gradual or total replacement with anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis[33], Morbiluncus spp. [34], Prevotella spp. [14], Mycoplasma hominis[21] and the recently identified metronidazole resistant Atopobium vaginae"
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Previous studies have shown that G. vaginalis (belonging to Actinobacteria), was found in most subjects with BV and showed higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of BV [14, 33, 74], but our data also found this species in subjects with low abundance level who did not have BV."
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,"With this aspect, Bradshaw et al. (2006) suggested that Atopobium was even more specific than G. vaginalis in BV (77% and 35%, respectively)"
Gardnerella vaginalis,Bacterial Vaginosis,It might be implicated that Prevotella showed a synergistic effect with G. vaginalis and aggravated the process of BV.
Lactobacillus  crispatus,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Lactobacillus species were the dominant bacteria detected (83 to 100 percent of clones per library; mean, 97 percent), particularly L. crispatus and L. iners. Most bacterial 16S rDNA sequences in subjects without bacterial vaginosis closely matched known bacteria."
Lactobacillus  crispatus,Bacterial Vaginosis,L. crispatus 16S rDNA was not detected in libraries of clones from subjects with bacterial vaginosis
Leptotrichia,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacteria frequently detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis included Atopobium vaginae, two megasphaera species, two distinct dialister phylotypes, Leptotrichia amnionii and the related bacterium Sneathia sanguinegens, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, and a bacterium distantly related to Eggerthella hongkongensis (92 percent sequence similarity). "
Leptotrichia,Bacterial Vaginosis,Detection of leptotrichia species was also very specific for bacterial vaginosis.
Leptotrichia,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Atopobium, leptotrichia, megasphaera, and eggerthella-like bacterial species were found in a high percentage of subjects who had bacterial vaginosis"
Leptotrichia,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Although no single bacterium could be identified as a specific marker for healthy over diseased conditions, three phyla - Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria, and eight genera including Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter were strongly associated with BV (p < 0.05). "
Leptotrichia,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Leptotrichia/Sneathia and Prevotella were more common and present at a higher copy numbers in the BV group"
Leptotrichia,Bacterial Vaginosis,"In our study, eight BV-related genera, i.e., Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter, were detected at higher prevalence and higher relative abundance in women with BV."
Leptotrichia,Bacterial Vaginosis,Our observations in qPCR and pyrosequencing studies showed that the prevalence of Leptotrichia/Sneathia in BV patients was higher than in CN subjects.
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacterium-specific PCR assays showed that atopobium species, megasphaera species, and an eggerthella-like uncultured bacterium were detected in a high percentage of subjects with bacterial vaginosis, and these assays had moderate specificity for bacterial vaginosis."
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other bacteria frequently detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis included Atopobium vaginae, two megasphaera species, two distinct dialister phylotypes, Leptotrichia amnionii and the related bacterium Sneathia sanguinegens, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, and a bacterium distantly related to Eggerthella hongkongensis (92 percent sequence similarity). "
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Atopobium, leptotrichia, megasphaera, and eggerthella-like bacterial species were found in a high percentage of subjects who had bacterial vaginosis, according to bacterium-specific PCR."
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Combinations of bacterium-specific PCR assays did not substantially improve sensitivity or specificity, except for the combination of BVAB1 and BVAB3, which yielded 100 percent specificity, and the combination of BVAB2 and megasphaera, which yielded 100 percent sensitivity in this small series."
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Of phylotypes unique to subjects with BV, nine were singletons (encountered only once), and the four most common (sequences most closely related to Olsenella, Megasphaera, Streptobacillus, and Shuttleworthia) accounted for 4%, 7%, 8%, and 9%, respectively, of all sequences retrieved from subjects with BV"
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Although no single bacterium could be identified as a specific marker for healthy over diseased conditions, three phyla - Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria, and eight genera including Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter were strongly associated with BV (p < 0.05)."
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Leptotrichia/Sneathia and Prevotella were more common and present at a higher copy numbers in the BV group, although there were significant interpersonal variations (data not shown). "
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"In our study, eight BV-related genera, i.e., Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter, were detected at higher prevalence and higher relative abundance in women with BV."
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Other members of the Firmicutes, Megasphaera (especially Megasphaera type☒), Aerococcus and Papillibacter, were also associated with BV significantly, although these genera could not be detected in all BV samples."
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,Previous work has shown that Megasphaera type☒ appeared to have a stronger association with BV than type
Megasphaera,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Although no single bacterium can be identified as uniquely associated with BV, our data indicated that the vaginal communities including Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Aerococcus, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Prevotella and Papillibacter were clearly associated with BV."

Clostridium leptum,Crohn's disease(CD),"The C coccoides group was significantly less represented in UC than in the other 3 groups, whereas the C leptum group was significantly less represented in CD."
Clostridium leptum,Crohn's disease(CD),Manichanh et al reported a restriction of biodiversity in the fecal microbiota of CD patients and particularly in the C. leptum group.
Clostridium leptum,Crohn's disease(CD),"Moreover, a quantitative reduction in the C. leptum group has been associated with CD"
Clostridium leptum,Crohn's disease(CD),"Again, the F. prausnitzii species within the C. leptum group has been shown to be particularly deficient in CD patients' MAM"
Clostridium difficile,Allergic sensitization,"Infants colonised with Clostridium difficile were at higher risk of developing eczema, recurrent wheeze and allergic sensitisation"
Clostridium difficile,Allergic sensitization,Linneberg and colleagues found a positive association between IgG seropositivity against C difficile and both allergic rhinitis and sensitisation.
Clostridium difficile,Atopic dermatitis,"Furthermore, several studies found an association between high numbers of the genus Clostridium and atopic dermatitis and/or sensitisation"
Clostridium difficile,Atopic dermatitis,"Furthermore, the presence of C difficile was also associated with a higher risk of a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis during the home visit"
Clostridium difficile,Atopic dermatitis,"Since E coli was only associated with eczema and C difficile was associated with all atopic outcomes, the underlying mechanisms explaining these association may be different."
Clostridium difficile,Atopic dermatitis,"The association between C difficile colonisation and eczema, atopic dermatitis, recurrent wheeze and atopic sensitisation was not influenced by the concentration of this bacterium in the faecal samples. "
Clostridium difficile,Atopic dermatitis,"Colonisation with C difficile in early infancy was associated with an increased risk of all atopic outcomes (eczema, atopic dermatitis, recurrent wheeze and atopic sensitisation), independent of the concentration of this bacterium."
Clostridium difficile,Atopic sensitisation,Colonisation with C difficile was furthermore associated with a higher risk of developing recurrent wheeze and atopic sensitisation
Clostridium difficile,Atopic sensitisation,"Since E coli was only associated with eczema and C difficile was associated with all atopic outcomes, the underlying mechanisms explaining these association may be different."

Clostridium difficile,Eczema,"Infants colonised with Clostridium difficile were at higher risk of developing eczema, recurrent wheeze and allergic sensitisation"
Clostridium difficile,Eczema,Infants colonised with C difficile were also at higher risk of eczema compared with uncolonised infants.
Clostridium difficile,Eczema,"Since E coli was only associated with eczema and C difficile was associated with all atopic outcomes, the underlying mechanisms explaining these association may be different."

Escherichia coli,Eczema,The presence of Escherichia coli was associated with a higher risk of developing eczema
Escherichia coli,Eczema,E coli was only associated with eczema
Escherichia coli,Eczema,Infants with high E coli counts in their stools had a twofold higher risk of developing eczema compared with uncolonised infants.
Escherichia coli,Eczema,"The presence of E coli was associated with a higher risk of developing eczema, this risk being increased with increasing numbers of E coli."
Escherichia coli,Eczema,The increased risk of eczema in infants colonised with E coli may therefore also be limited to eczema other than at the specific predilection sites for atopic eczema/dermatitis and thus may be non-atopic.
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,"Acquisition of Helicobacter pylori, which predominantly occurs before age 10 years, may reduce risks of asthma and allergy."
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,Consistent inverse associations were found between H pylori colonization and the presence of allergy symptoms in the previous year and sensitization to pollens and molds.
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,These observations support the hypothesis that childhood acquisition of H pylori is associated with reduced risks of asthma and allergy.
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,"For the present analysis, the internal validity, that is, the relationships of H pylori status with asthma and allergy, is considered to be more important than generalization to the total US population"
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,Colonization with either a cagA+ or a cagA− strain of H pylori was inversely associated with having had 1 of a group of specified allergy symptoms in the previous 12 months
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,The associations of H pyloricagA− and cagA+ status with allergy were not significantly different (P=.83) and were apparent only in younger adults.
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,"Compared with participants withoutH pylori, those with cagA strains were significantly or marginally significantly less likely to have allergy symptoms due to exposure to pollens, animals, or house dust, especially younger adults "
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,"Colonization with H pylori also was inversely related to having had allergic rhinitis, allergy symptoms, and skin sensitization due to pollens and molds, especially in younger adults."
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,"A few studies have reported no associations41,42 or weak inverse associations40,43-45 of H pylori colonization with asthma and allergy."
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,"That H pylori cagA+ status was inversely related to the presence of allergic rhinitis, self-reported allergy symptoms, and skin sensitization suggests that the protection related to H pylori(especially cagA+ strains) may not be specific for asthma but extends to other allergic conditions."
Helicobacter pylori,Allergy,"The present study and others collectively provide evidence that colonization with H pylori, especially cagA+ strains, may reduce risks of asthma and allergy."
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"Acquisition of Helicobacter pylori, which predominantly occurs before age 10 years, may reduce risks of asthma and allergy."

Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"That H pylori cagA+ status was inversely related to the presence of allergic rhinitis, self-reported allergy symptoms, and skin sensitization suggests that the protection related to H pylori(especially cagA+ strains) may not be specific for asthma but extends to other allergic conditions."
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"The present study and others collectively provide evidence that colonization with H pylori, especially cagA+ strains, may reduce risks of asthma and allergy."
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,The presence of cagA+ H pylori strains was inversely related to ever having asthma
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"herein we address the hypothesis that H pylori acquisition, which predominantly occurs before age 10 years,22-24 is associated with reduced subsequent risks of asthma and allergy."
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"For the present analysis, the internal validity, that is, the relationships of H pylori status with asthma and allergy, is considered to be more important than generalization to the total US population"

Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,H pyloricagA strains were less likely to have ever been diagnosed as having asthma compared with those without H pylori
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,Colonization with a cagA+ H pylori strain was inversely associated with ever having had asthma only in younger participants
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"Using the NHANES III database, we found that colonization with cagA+ strains of H pylori was inversely related to ever having had asthma, especially in younger adults and for asthma cases with onset during childhood. "
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"These trends and associations suggest the hypothesis that H pylori, especially cagA+ strains, could be protective against asthma"
Helicobacter pylori,Asthma,"A few studies have reported no associations41,42 or weak inverse associations40,43-45 of H pylori colonization with asthma and allergy."

Clostridium cocleatum,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),"From the 9 assays designed on a phylogenetic basis, 3 ( Collinsella aerofaciens, Clostridium cocleatum –related and Coprococcus eutactus –related phylotype assays) showed statistically significant differences ( P < .05) between the 22 control subject and 24 IBS patient samples tested"
Clostridium cocleatum,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),"In the phylum Firmicutes , the real-time PCR assays for Coprococcus eutactus – and Clostridium cocleatum –related sequences revealed differences between the patients with IBS and healthy control subjects, while the other assays for members of Firmicutes remained statistically nonsignificant"
Collinsella aerofaciens,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),"From the 9 assays designed on a phylogenetic basis, 3 ( Collinsella aerofaciens, Clostridium cocleatum –related and Coprococcus eutactus –related phylotype assays) showed statistically significant differences ( P < .05) between the 22 control subject and 24 IBS patient samples tested"
Collinsella aerofaciens,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),"In contrast, the prevalence of C aerofaciens among patients with IBS was considerably lower."
Collinsella aerofaciens,Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS),"Moreover, significant ( P < .05) differences between the clone libraries were found in several bacterial genera, which could be verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays of phylotypes belonging to the genera Coprococcus , Collinsella , and Coprobacillus .

Actinobacteria,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),"Sequences representative of the Bacteroidetes (P < 0.001) and Lachnospiraceae (P < 0.001) were greatly depleted, and those of the Actinobacteria (P < 0.001) and Proteobacteria (P < 0.001) were substantially more abundant in IBD-subset samples, relative to Control-subset samples."
Actinobacteria,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),Actinobacterial sequences also were more prevalent in the small intestine (8% of clones in non-IBD samples compared with 2% from non-IBD colon). 
Actinobacteria,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),A diverse variety of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria was increased in prevalence in the IBD subset.
Lachnospiraceae,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),"Lachnospiraceae sequences of non-IBD samples were intermediate in abundance between UC and CD samples, whereas Bacteroidetes sequences were unaffected by disease status."
Lachnospiraceae,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),"Sequences representative of the Bacteroidetes (P < 0.001) and Lachnospiraceae (P < 0.001) were greatly depleted, and those of the Actinobacteria (P < 0.001) and Proteobacteria (P < 0.001) were substantially more abundant in IBD-subset samples, relative to Control-subset samples."
Lachnospiraceae,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),"In contrast, most of the OTUs that were decreased in prevalence in the IBD subset belonged to either the Lachnospiraceae group or the phylum Bacteroidetes."
Lachnospiraceae,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),Q-PCR also confirmed that members of the Lachnospiraceae (P < 0.001) and Bacteroidetes (P < 0.001) were diminished in quantity in the IBD-subset samples 
Lachnospiraceae,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),The differences in IBD- and Control-subset clonal frequencies must therefore reflect diminution of Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidetes microbial populations in patients' samples classified as IBD subset rather than increased absolute levels of proteobacteria.
Lachnospiraceae,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),"Bacteroidetes and Lachnospiraceae were depleted 1.7 and 2.5 orders of magnitude, respectively, in specimens of the IBD subset."
Proteobacteria,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),"Sequences representative of the Bacteroidetes (P < 0.001) and Lachnospiraceae (P < 0.001) were greatly depleted, and those of the Actinobacteria (P < 0.001) and Proteobacteria (P < 0.001) were substantially more abundant in IBD-subset samples, relative to Control-subset samples."
Proteobacteria,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),A diverse variety of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria was increased in prevalence in the IBD subset.
Proteobacteria,Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD),"Among the small-intestine samples, proteobacterial sequences were more abundant and Bacillus sequences less abundant in both UC and CD sample sets relative to non-IBD samples."

Dietzia maris,Atopic dermatitis,"On the other hand, D. maris (peak set X) was significantly more common in the controls (2/13 AD patients and 8/10 controls, P = 0.003; Table 5T5)."
Dietzia maris,Atopic dermatitis,our findings suggest that the skin microbiota of AD patients serve as a reservoir for such opportunistic pathogens. D. maris is a common bacterium found in ponds and on the surface of fish. 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,Atopic dermatitis,"Among 18 species detected in the study, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected significantly more commonly in AD patients (5/13 for AD patients vs 0/10 for controls), whilst Dietzia maris was detected significantly more commonly in normal controls"

Lysobacter,Cystic fibrosis,"In four CF subjects, candidate pathogens were identified and include the anaerobe Prevotella denticola, a Lysobacter sp., and members of the Rickettsiales."
Lysobacter,Cystic fibrosis,"One candidate for a new CF pathogen is a member of the genus Lysobacter, which is not usually considered a pathogen but is closely related (97% rRNA sequence identity) to pathogenic members of the genus Stenotrophomonas."
Rickettsiales,Cystic fibrosis,Two CF specimens contained sequences that represent novel examples of α-Proteobacteria specifically related to members of the Coxiellaceae (Fig. 4C) and Rickettsiales

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,Cystic fibrosis,"Other bacteria, including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, also are associated with CF, but there is controversy as to their roles as pathogens."
Streptococcus mitis,Cystic fibrosis,"Two of the low-complexity DC libraries contained a single sequence type, in one case Streptococcus mitis group (which includes S. pneumoniae) sequences and in the other H. influenzae sequences."
Staphylococcus aureus,Obesity,The microbiota aberrancy during infancy in children becoming overweight was also associated with a greater number of Staphylococcus aureus [0.64 × 106 cells/g (0.33–1.00× 106 cells/g)] than in children remaining normal weight.

B. vulgatus, B. uniformis and B. ovatus were the most abundant Bacteroides species detected."
Bacteroides ovatus,Ileal Crohn's disease(CD),"By contrast, there was a trend that the TRFs corresponding to B. ovatus (264; P=0.08) and B. vulgatus (83 and 142, P=0.12) were present in higher abundances in patients with ileal involvement"

Lactobacillus,Bacterial Vaginosis,"Subjects without BV had bacterial communities dominated by Lactobacillus species, accounting for 86% of all sequences from subjects without BV"
Lactobacillus,Bacterial Vaginosis,"In the case of subjects without BV, fewer sequences were obtained due to many fewer restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns because of the dominance by Lactobacillus. Richness estimators (Table 1) indicated subjects without BV were adequately sampled, and additional diversity will be discovered in subjects with BV."

Propionibacterium,Psoriasis,"In addition, representation of Propionibacterium species was lower in psoriasis than in normal skin."
Propionibacterium,Psoriasis,"Furthermore, at the genus level Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium were the commonest in controls and psoriasis, respectively in the Gao et al. study, whereas we found Streptococci to be the commonest genus in both groups."
Propionibacterium acnes,Psoriasis,"The ratio of Streptococcus mitis to Propionibacterium acnes is 0.2. Panel D. Samples from the lesions (n = 13) of patients with psoriasis (n = 1,314 clones)."
Propionibacterium acnes,Psoriasis,Propionibacterium acnes was the most prevalent species in the samples from the healthy subjects (Mean±SD:20.2±16.0%) and from the unaffected skin of the patients with psoriasis
Propionibacterium acnes,Psoriasis,"Third, there was a striking and progressive underrepresentation of the genus Propionibacterium, and its major human species P. acnes, as the samples from healthy persons, healthy skin from psoriasis patients, and psoriatic lesions were compared"
Propionibacterium acnes,Psoriasis,Representation of P. acnes was much lower (2.6±5.1%) in the samples from the lesions of the patients with psoriasis than in the samples from normal persons
Streptococcus,Psoriasis,"An extensive literature also has suggested that bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, could play a role in the induction and maintenance of psoriasis"
Streptococcus,Psoriasis,"Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium were the dominant genera in the samples from normal skin, including healthy persons and patients with psoriasis, as well as from the psoriatic lesions, accounting for >50% of all clones."
Streptococcus,Psoriasis,Streptococcus were detected significantly more frequently (15.2±10.4%) from psoriatic lesion samples (P<0.001) than from the uninvolved skin samples of the patients (3.4±2.5%). 
Streptococcus,Psoriasis,"Favoring these microbial competition hypotheses is the greater representation of streptococcal and staphylococcal species in the psoriatic lesions, however, Group A Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were absent or minimally present."
Alcaligenaceae,Obesity,"Three other families—Coriobacteriaceae (phylum Actinobacteria), Erysipelotrichaceae (phylum Firmicutes), and Alcaligenaceae (phylum Proteobacteria)—also were somewhat enriched in the ob group"
Coriobacteriaceae,Obesity,"Three other families—Coriobacteriaceae (phylum Actinobacteria), Erysipelotrichaceae (phylum Firmicutes), and Alcaligenaceae (phylum Proteobacteria)—also were somewhat enriched in the ob group"
Erysipelotrichaceae,Obesity,"Three other families—Coriobacteriaceae (phylum Actinobacteria), Erysipelotrichaceae (phylum Firmicutes), and Alcaligenaceae (phylum Proteobacteria)—also were somewhat enriched in the ob group"
Erysipelotrichaceae,Obesity,The family Prevotellaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Erysipelotrichaceae within phylum Firmicutes harbored sequences mostly from obese individuals (indicated in red). 
Methanobrevibacter smithii,Obesity,"In particular, recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play a role in obesity by increasing the host's energy-harvesting efficiency (2–4). A mouse model has shown that Methanobrevibacter smithii, the predominant archaeon in the human gut, enhanced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production by fermentative bacteria by removing H2 and formate."
Prevotellaceae,Obesity,Numbers of the H2-producing Prevotellaceae were highly enriched in the obese individuals.
Prevotellaceae,Obesity,The family Prevotellaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Erysipelotrichaceae within phylum Firmicutes harbored sequences mostly from obese individuals (indicated in red).
Prevotellaceae,Obesity,"The obesity-specific Prevotellaceae group contains carbohydrate- and protein-fermenting, acetate and H2 producers, as inferred by their cultured phylogenetic relatives, such as Prevotella ruminicola"
Prevotellaceae,Obesity,"Possible H2-producing bacterial partners could be members of Prevotellaceae (phylum Bacteroidetes), which we also found associated with obese individuals."
Prevotellaceae,Obesity,"But our results clearly show that Prevotellaceae, a subgroup of Bacteroidetes, was significantly enriched in the obese individuals."
Prevotellaceae,Obesity,"Our results extend the findings of others by demonstrating that obese individuals harbor unique H2-producing bacterial groups, particularly members of the Prevotellaceae family and certain groups within Firmicutes."
Enterobacteriaceae,Crohn's disease(CD),Enterobacteria and particularly E. coli have been deeply investigated.
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,Crohn's disease(CD),Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species (a major representative of the C. leptum group) had lower counts in A-IBD and IC patients compared to HS (8.8 and 8.3 versus 10.4; P = 0.0004 and P = 0.003).
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,Crohn's disease(CD),In the present study the decreased count of F. prausnitzii observed in R-IBD patients (9.5 ± 0.4) did not reach significance compared to HS
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,Crohn's disease(CD),"Again, the F. prausnitzii species within the C. leptum group has been shown to be particularly deficient in CD patients' MAM."
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,Crohn's disease(CD),"In the present work, Firmicutes and F. prausnitzii counts were decreased in IC patients as well as in A-CD and A-UC patients."
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,Crohn's disease(CD),"Conversely, a healthy gut microbiota structure including a proper count of Firmicutes (in particular F. prausnitzii) could be a protective factor for the gut mucosa whatever the chronic gut inflammation condition (CD or UC). "
Firmicutes,Crohn's disease(CD),"Bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes (Clostridium leptum and Clostridium coccoides groups) were less represented in A-IBD patients (9.7; P = 0.004) and IC (9.4; P = 0.02), compared to HS (10.8)."
Firmicutes,Crohn's disease(CD),"The phylum Firmicutes and particularly the species F. prausnitzii, are underrepresented in A-IBD patients as well as in IC patients. "
Firmicutes,Crohn's disease(CD),"In the present work, Firmicutes and F. prausnitzii counts were decreased in IC patients as well as in A-CD and A-UC patients. "
Firmicutes,Crohn's disease(CD),"However, one can hypothesize that a primary distortion in gut Firmicutes, as observed in R-IBD patients (confirmed by PLS regression analysis), could predispose to pathological conditions such as IBD."
Firmicutes,Crohn's disease(CD),Firmicutes (in particular F. prausnitzii) could be a protective factor for the gut mucosa whatever the chronic gut inflammation condition (CD or UC).
Enterobacter aerogenes,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"In samples collected from the control group, the most frequently detected representative OTUs were ECC226e09 (six infants), ECC237b02 (four infants), ECC247c07 (six infants), ECC289a06 (five infants) and ECC227b03 (five infants), which exhibited the highest levels of similarity (99–100%) to Veillonella sp., E. coli, Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, respectively."
Enterobacter hormaechei,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"owever, for samples from NEC patients, the most frequently detected representative OTUs were ECN224a01 (six patients), ECN232e08 (six patients), ECN224d08 (four patients) and ECN291c02 (four patients), which were closely related (99–100%) to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter hormaechei and E. coli."
Enterobacter hormaechei,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Certain phylotypes such as K. pneumoniae, S. dysenteriae and Enterobacter hormaechei, could be identified in both the NEC and healthy twins."
Enterococcus,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"In samples collected from the control group, the most frequently detected representative OTUs were ECC226e09 (six infants), ECC237b02 (four infants), ECC247c07 (six infants), ECC289a06 (five infants) and ECC227b03 (five infants), which exhibited the highest levels of similarity (99–100%) to Veillonella sp., E. coli, Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, respectively."
Enterococcus,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,A 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis detected Citrobacter-like sequences only in cases with NEC (3 of 4) and an increased frequency of Enterococcus-like sequences in cases and Klebsiella in control subjects (P = .06).
Enterococcus,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,Higher numbers of Enterococcus were more frequently detected in cases with NEC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome compared with in control subjects.
Firmicutes,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Consistent with the demonstrated difference in diversity between control and NEC infants, for control infants four phyla were present: Proteobacteria, (34.97% relative abundance), Firmicutes (57.79%), Bacteroidetes (2.45%) and Fusobacteria (0.54%) with 4.25% unclassified bacteria."
Firmicutes,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"However, NEC patients had only two phyla, Proteobacteria (90.72%) and Firmicutes (9.12%) with 0.16% unclassified bacteria. "
Firmicutes,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,We detected a bloom (34% increase) of Proteobacteria and a decrease (32%) in Firmicutes in NEC cases between the 1 week and <72 hour samples.
Firmicutes,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,We observed a 34% increase in the proportion of Proteobacteria in NEC infants at the expense of a 32% decrease in Firmicutes that occurred over the week before the diagnosis of NEC.
Firmicutes,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,In NEC infants Firmicutes dominated at the earlier time point.
Gammaproteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Patients with NEC had even less diversity, an increase in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, a decrease in other bacteria species, and had received a higher mean number of previous days of antibiotics. "
Gammaproteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Furthermore, at level 2, Gammaproteobacteria was the major detected class of the phylum Proteobacteria in both control and NEC infants."
Gammaproteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"As shown in Figure 3, for both control and NEC infants, phylotypes that were affiliated with the class Gammaproteobacteria constructed the largest phylogenetic clade in the tree."
Gammaproteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"The phylogenetic tree indicates that for most of the OTUs of Gammaproteobacteria identified in NEC infants, the same phylotypes or their closely related sequences could also be found in control infants."
Gammaproteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Infants in different nurseries may harbor different specific bacterial strains, yet patients with NEC still have decreased diversity and increased Gammaproteobacteria dominance."
Gammaproteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"we suggest that this approach should be studied further to determine its utility as a prognostication tool for identification of preterm infants at highest risk for development of NEC who could then be treated with targeted therapy (for example, to Gammaproteobacterias), fresh breast milk or probiotic agents."
Klebsiella pneumoniae,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"However, for samples from NEC patients, the most frequently detected representative OTUs were ECN224a01 (six patients), ECN232e08 (six patients), ECN224d08 (four patients) and ECN291c02 (four patients), which were closely related (99–100%) to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter hormaechei and E. coli."
Klebsiella pneumoniae,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Certain phylotypes such as K. pneumoniae, S. dysenteriae and Enterobacter hormaechei, could be identified in both the NEC and healthy twins."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Consistent with the demonstrated difference in diversity between control and NEC infants, for control infants four phyla were present: Proteobacteria, (34.97% relative abundance), Firmicutes (57.79%), Bacteroidetes (2.45%) and Fusobacteria (0.54%) with 4.25% unclassified bacteria."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"However, NEC patients had only two phyla, Proteobacteria (90.72%) and Firmicutes (9.12%) with 0.16% unclassified bacteria. "
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Patients with NEC had even less diversity, an increase in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, a decrease in other bacteria species, and had received a higher mean number of previous days of antibiotics."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,Further exploration showed that the high abundance of Proteobacteria in NEC infants included dominance (more than 50%) of one genera of Proteobacteria in each individual patient.
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,Individual pairings had decreased diversity and increased percentage of Proteobacteria in the twin with NEC (N1-N4) compared to the twin control
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Furthermore, the limited diversity and Proteobacteria dominance in NEC patients represented a unique bacterial pattern associated with NEC by PCA."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Furthermore, we document that all preterm infants with NEC have a Proteobacteria predominance."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Rather, we find that the microbial community structure in NEC patients is distinct, based on a further decrease in diversity and increase in Proteobacteria dominance compared to other preterm infants, and with a bloom of a single genus of Proteobacteria to >50% of the overall bacterial composition."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,These pairings represent ideal matched control sets and again demonstrated the decreased diversity and Proteobacteria dominance in the patient with NEC.
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,We detected a bloom (34% increase) of Proteobacteria and a decrease (32%) in Firmicutes in NEC cases between the 1 week and <72 hour samples.
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,One of the bacterial signatures detected more frequently in NEC cases (p<0.01) matched closest to γ-Proteobacteria.
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,We observed a 34% increase in the proportion of Proteobacteria in NEC infants at the expense of a 32% decrease in Firmicutes that occurred over the week before the diagnosis of NEC.
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Furthermore, we observed that the proportion of Proteobacteria increased in samples collected from NEC infants over the week prior to the diagnosis of NEC."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"In the samples collected from the NEC infants one week before diagnosis, the proportion of Proteobacteria was actually lower than that observed in the matched control samples."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"However, during inflammation (as occurs in diseases such as NEC), there is a relative decrease in the presence of these less immunogenic bacteria and a relative increase in Proteobacteria, as shown by our results."
Proteobacteria,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,In addition to specific OTUs that appeared to be associated with NEC we also detected a bloom in Proteobacteria unique to the NEC infants.
Shigella dysenteriae,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"However, for samples from NEC patients, the most frequently detected representative OTUs were ECN224a01 (six patients), ECN232e08 (six patients), ECN224d08 (four patients) and ECN291c02 (four patients), which were closely related (99–100%) to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter hormaechei and E. coli."
Shigella dysenteriae,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Certain phylotypes such as K. pneumoniae, S. dysenteriae and Enterobacter hormaechei, could be identified in both the NEC and healthy twins."
Staphylococcus,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"In samples collected from the control group, the most frequently detected representative OTUs were ECC226e09 (six infants), ECC237b02 (four infants), ECC247c07 (six infants), ECC289a06 (five infants) and ECC227b03 (five infants), which exhibited the highest levels of similarity (99–100%) to Veillonella sp., E. coli, Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, respectively. "
Veillonella,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"In samples collected from the control group, the most frequently detected representative OTUs were ECC226e09 (six infants), ECC237b02 (four infants), ECC247c07 (six infants), ECC289a06 (five infants) and ECC227b03 (five infants), which exhibited the highest levels of similarity (99–100%) to Veillonella sp., E. coli, Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, respectively. "
Citrobacter,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,A 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis detected Citrobacter-like sequences only in cases with NEC (3 of 4) and an increased frequency of Enterococcus-like sequences in cases and Klebsiella in control subjects (P = .06).
Enterobacteriaceae,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"In contrast, Klebsiella was more frequently detected in control subjects compared with both cases of NEC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = .06). In addition, we detected 2 OTUs with closest matches to Enterobacteriaceae that were detected in higher proportion in control subjects (P < .05). "
Enterobacteriaceae,Systemic inflammatory response syndrome,"In contrast, Klebsiella was more frequently detected in control subjects compared with both cases of NEC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = .06). In addition, we detected 2 OTUs with closest matches to Enterobacteriaceae that were detected in higher proportion in control subjects (P < .05). "
Enterococcus,Systemic inflammatory response syndrome,Higher numbers of Enterococcus were more frequently detected in cases with NEC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome compared with in control subjects.
Klebsiella,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,A 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis detected Citrobacter-like sequences only in cases with NEC (3 of 4) and an increased frequency of Enterococcus-like sequences in cases and Klebsiella in control subjects (P = .06).
Klebsiella,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"In contrast, Klebsiella was more frequently detected in control subjects compared with both cases of NEC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = .06)."
Klebsiella,Systemic inflammatory response syndrome,"In contrast, Klebsiella was more frequently detected in control subjects compared with both cases of NEC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = .06)."
Bacteroidetes,Asthma,"Conversely, Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella spp., were more frequent in controls than adult or child asthmatics or COPD patients."
Bacteroidetes,Asthma,"In contrast, Bacteroidetes members were more common in controls compared to diseased subjects (Pc<10−4 controls versus COPD; Pc<10−2 controls versus asthma)."
Bacteroidetes,COPD,"Conversely, Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella spp., were more frequent in controls than adult or child asthmatics or COPD patients."
Bacteroidetes,COPD,"In contrast, Bacteroidetes members were more common in controls compared to diseased subjects (Pc<10−4 controls versus COPD; Pc<10−2 controls versus asthma)."
Bacteroidetes,COPD,The reduction of Bacteroidetes in patients with asthma and COPD compared to controls may also be relevant to disease.
Haemophilus,Asthma,"Pathogenic Proteobacteria, particularly Haemophilus spp., were much more frequent in bronchi of adult asthmatics or patients with COPD than controls."
Haemophilus,Asthma,Members of the genus Haemophilus were most strongly associated with the presence of COPD (Pc<10−4) and asthma (Pc<10−7)
Haemophilus,Asthma,"Despite these cautions, it is striking that Haemophilus, Moraxella and Neisseria spp. found by us in asthmatic airways have also been shown to carry increased risk for asthma in early life when found in neonatal throat swabs"
Haemophilus,Asthma,"Asymptomatic neonates whose throats are colonized with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis are at increased risk for recurrent wheeze and asthma early in life"
Haemophilus,COPD,"Pathogenic Proteobacteria, particularly Haemophilus spp., were much more frequent in bronchi of adult asthmatics or patients with COPD than controls."
Haemophilus,COPD,Members of the genus Haemophilus were most strongly associated with the presence of COPD (Pc<10−4) and asthma (Pc<10−7)
Haemophilus,COPD,"Collectively, our results provide a unifying framework for characterizing the role of Pseudomonas and Haemophilus in the development, progression and/or exacerbation of COPD."
Haemophilus,COPD,"Prior to the use of culture-independent techniques, Haemophilus was the organism most frequently grown from samples of COPD lungs [35], with Pseudomonas oftentimes noted"
Haemophilus,COPD,"A previous study [12] found a significant correlation between COPD and the presence of Haemophilus spp. in sterile brushings of the left upper lobes. At first pass, this finding appears to conflict with the domination by Pseudomonas spp."
Prevotella,Asthma,"Conversely, Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella spp., were more frequent in controls than adult or child asthmatics or COPD patients."
Prevotella,Asthma,"At the level of genera, the asthmatic subjects were characterised by excess of Haemophilus spp. (Pc<10−12) and Staphylococcus spp. (Pc<10−2), whereas Prevotella spp. were more frequent in controls (Pc<10−30)."
Prevotella,COPD,"Conversely, Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella spp., were more frequent in controls than adult or child asthmatics or COPD patients."
Proteobacteria,Asthma,"Pathogenic Proteobacteria, particularly Haemophilus spp., were much more frequent in bronchi of adult asthmatics or patients with COPD than controls."
Proteobacteria,Asthma,We found similar highly significant increases in Proteobacteria in asthmatic children.
Proteobacteria,Asthma,We found members of the phylum Proteobacteria to occur highly significantly more often in the COPD (Pc<10−14) and asthma (Pc<10−13) groups compared to controls
Proteobacteria,Asthma,"We found from the distribution of the phyla that Proteobacteria were more frequent in asthmatic children compared to controls (Pc<10−13), whereas Bacterioidetes were more common in the controls than in asthmatics (Pc<10−16) "
Proteobacteria,COPD,"Pathogenic Proteobacteria, particularly Haemophilus spp., were much more frequent in bronchi of adult asthmatics or patients with COPD than controls."
Proteobacteria,COPD,We found members of the phylum Proteobacteria to occur highly significantly more often in the COPD (Pc<10−14) and asthma (Pc<10−13) groups compared to controls
Staphylococcus,Asthma,"At the level of genera, the asthmatic subjects were characterised by excess of Haemophilus spp. (Pc<10−12) and Staphylococcus spp. (Pc<10−2), whereas Prevotella spp. were more frequent in controls (Pc<10−30)."
Staphylococcus,Asthma,"Our data suggest that Staphylococcus spp. are also present in excess in the airways of children with difficult asthma, and it is likely that wider exploration of children and adults with asthma will identify a range of organisms associated with the disease, including Mycoplasma spp. and Chlamydia spp."
Bacilli,Type 2 diabetes,"The significantly higher levels of Bacilli and the Lactobacillus group in diabetic subjects compared to controls in the present study, have recently been reported in relation to type 2 diabetes in mice models [6] and to obesity in human adults"
Bacteroidetes,Type 2 diabetes,Phylum Bacteroidetes was primarily presented by class Bacteroidetes that was on average slightly increased in diabetics (44%) compared to controls (33%;
Bacteroidetes,Type 2 diabetes,"At the level of bacterial classes the variation was predominantly linked to a higher positive score for Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Bacilli in the diabetic group, versus Clostridia and Erysipelotrichi in the control group"
Bacteroidetes,Type 2 diabetes,"The relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower, while the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria was somewhat higher in diabetic persons compared to their non-diabetic counterparts."
Bacteroidetes,Type 2 diabetes,"The intestinal microbiota across the subjects with type 2 diabetes was relatively enriched with Gram-negative bacteria, belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria."
Betaproteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,"Similarly, class Betaproteobacteria was highly enriched in diabetic compared to non-diabetic persons (P = 0.02) and positively correlated with plasma glucose (P = 0.04)."
Betaproteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,"Similarly, class Betaproteobacteria, belonging to Proteobacteria, was highly enriched in subjects with diabetes (mean 2.09% versus 0.81% in controls; P = 0.02) and positively correlated (R = 0.46, P = 0.04) with plasma glucose"
Clostridia,Type 2 diabetes,The proportions of phylum Firmicutes and class Clostridia were significantly reduced in the diabetic group compared to the control group (P = 0.03). 
Clostridia,Type 2 diabetes,"Bacterial groups that distinguished the diabetic from the non-diabetic microbiome included Bacteroides-Prevotella group versus class Clostridia and C. coccoides-E.rectale group, which ratios were significantly higher in diabetic persons."
Clostridium,Type 2 diabetes,"Accordingly, a significant reduction in Clostridium ssp, C. coccoides and an increase in the Bacteroides-Prevotella group along with body weight loss have been observed in human studies"
Clostridium coccoides,Type 2 diabetes,"Bacterial groups that distinguished the diabetic from the non-diabetic microbiome included Bacteroides-Prevotella group versus class Clostridia and C. coccoides-E.rectale group, which ratios were significantly higher in diabetic persons."
Firmicutes,Type 2 diabetes,The proportions of phylum Firmicutes and class Clostridia were significantly reduced in the diabetic group compared to the control group (P = 0.03).

Firmicutes,Type 2 diabetes,"The relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower, while the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria was somewhat higher in diabetic persons compared to their non-diabetic counterparts"
Lactobacillus,Type 2 diabetes,"The significantly higher levels of Bacilli and the Lactobacillus group in diabetic subjects compared to controls in the present study, have recently been reported in relation to type 2 diabetes in mice models and to obesity in human adults"
Lactobacillus,Type 2 diabetes,Genus Lactobacillus represents a heterogeneous group with well documented immunomodulating properties [19] and might potentially contribute to chronic inflammation in diabetic subjects
Proteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,"The intestinal microbiota across the subjects with type 2 diabetes was relatively enriched with Gram-negative bacteria, belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. "
Proteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,"Similarly, class Betaproteobacteria was highly enriched in diabetic compared to non-diabetic persons (P = 0.02) and positively correlated with plasma glucose (P = 0.04)."
Proteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,"Similarly, class Betaproteobacteria, belonging to Proteobacteria, was highly enriched in subjects with diabetes (mean 2.09% versus 0.81% in controls; P = 0.02) and positively correlated (R = 0.46, P = 0.04) with plasma glucose"
Proteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,"The relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower, while the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria was somewhat higher in diabetic persons compared to their non-diabetic counterparts."
Proteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,"The intestinal microbiota across the subjects with type 2 diabetes was relatively enriched with Gram-negative bacteria, belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria."
Proteobacteria,Type 2 diabetes,RYGB was found to be associated with a decrease in Firmicutes together with an increase in γ-Proteobacteria in three adults
Bacteroidaceae,Type 1 diabetes,Bacteroidaceae was the dominant family of the Bacteroidetes phylum and was significantly more abundant in cases than in controls
Bacteroides,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those species (Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, E. rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, human intestinal firmicute CB47 and human intestinal firmicute CO19), each represented at least 1% of all sequences. "
Bacteroides,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those 22 species, 5 species (bacterium mpn-isolate group 18, B. ovatus, Bacteroides sp. CJ78, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis) represented more than 1% of all sequences each."
Bacteroides,Type 1 diabetes,The greatest % differences between cases and controls were in the genera Prevotella and Bacteroides where Prevotella was much more abundant in controls and Bacteroides was much higher in cases
Bacteroides,Type 1 diabetes,"In addition, cases have a much larger population of bacteria such as Bacteroides, Veillonella and Alistipes compared to controls."
Bacteroides fragilis,Type 1 diabetes,"However, two Bacteorides species, B. vulgatus and B. fragilis, are observed at much higher levels in controls than in cases at the third time point and represent more than 11% of total sequences in the control samples."
Bacteroides fragilis,Type 1 diabetes,"Similarly, 15 bacterial species were found to be significantly more abundant (P<0.01) in controls compared with cases in all four pairs of children at the third time point. Of those species (Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, E. rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, human intestinal firmicute CB47 and human intestinal firmicute CO19), each represented at least 1% of all sequences."
Bacteroides ovatus,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those 22 species, 5 species (bacterium mpn-isolate group 18, B. ovatus, Bacteroides sp. CJ78, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis) represented more than 1% of all sequences each."
Bacteroides ovatus,Type 1 diabetes,"A single species, Bacteroides ovatus, comprised nearly 24% of the total increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes in cases compared with controls."
Bacteroides sp. CJ78,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those 22 species, 5 species (bacterium mpn-isolate group 18, B. ovatus, Bacteroides sp. CJ78, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis) represented more than 1% of all sequences each."
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those 22 species, 5 species (bacterium mpn-isolate group 18, B. ovatus, Bacteroides sp. CJ78, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis) represented more than 1% of all sequences each."
Bacteroides uniformis,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those 22 species, 5 species (bacterium mpn-isolate group 18, B. ovatus, Bacteroides sp. CJ78, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis) represented more than 1% of all sequences each."
Bacteroides vulgatus,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those species (Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, E. rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, human intestinal firmicute CB47 and human intestinal firmicute CO19), each represented at least 1% of all sequences."
Bacteroidetes,Type 1 diabetes,The differences in abundance of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes observed between cases and controls were significant at all three time points.
Bacteroidetes,Type 1 diabetes,"One striking result of this analysis is the decline in Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes in the gut microbiome overtime as children become autoimmune; in contrast, Firmicutes increase as Bacteroidetes declines in healthy children"
Bacteroidetes,Type 1 diabetes,"The second characteristic is the high ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in cases, which is observed within the first 6 months after birth, compared with the low ratio found in controls."
Bacteroidetes,Type 1 diabetes,"With respect to human T1D, the proportion of bacteria within the phylum Bacteroidetes increases over time in unhealthy (i.e., autoantibody positive, “autoimmune”) subjects while in healthy non-T1D prone subjects, the proportion of the Firmicutes within the population increases"
Clostridia,Type 1 diabetes,"Many Lachnospiraceae were in higher abundance in BB-DP rats, whereas many unclassified Clostridiaceae were more common in BB-DR rats. "
Clostridia,Type 1 diabetes,"Conversely, as the abundance of Clostridia decreased overtime in the case samples, the Clostridia sequences increased in control samples."
Eubacteriaceae,Type 1 diabetes,"Analysis at the family level showed that three families among the Firmicutes, the Ruminococcaceae, the Lachnospiraceae and the Eubacteriaceae, were significantly more abundant in controls than in cases at time point 3."
Eubacterium eligens,Type 1 diabetes,"Of those species (Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, E. rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, human intestinal firmicute CB47 and human intestinal firmicute CO19), each represented at least 1% of all sequences."
