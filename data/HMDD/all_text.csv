hsa-mir-129,Thyroid Neoplasms,"Two HDACi, Trichostatin A and vorinostat, induced miR-129-5p overexpression, histone acetylation and cell death. In addition, miR-129-5p alone was sufficient to induce cell death and knockdown experiments showed that expression of this miRNA was required for HDACi-induced cell death. Moreover, miR-129-5p was also able to improve the anti-proliferative effects of other cancer drugs such as etoposide or HAMLET (human alpha lactalbumin made letal for tumor cells). Taken together, the data show that miR-129-5p is involved in the antitumor activity of HDACi and highlight that miRNA-driven cell death may be an efficient approach to cancer treatment."

High miRNA-21 expression was correlated with a worse prognosis in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (P=0.045). The immunohistochemical expression patterns of PDCD4 (reduced nuclear staining pattern) and TIMP3 (downregulated expression) were significantly associated with both the upregulated miR-21 expression (P<0.05) and the poor survival of the patients (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). Our data suggest that an overexpression of miRNA-21 is, therefore, associated with the biological behavior of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via the downregulation of the expression of tumor suppressors, PDCD4 and TIMP3, thus resulting in tumor progression and the adverse clinical course of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."

In situ hybridization of human lymph node sections revealed that miR-1293 is primarily expressed in the germinal centre but is deficient in the mantle zone of lymph nodes, where the expression of vIL-6 is often found in patients with KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease, providing evidence of an anatomical correlation."

Furthermore, we find that increased levels of miR-155 radioprotects lung cancer cells, while inhibition of miR-155 radiosensitizes these cells. Moreover, we reveal a therapeutically important link between miR-155 expression, hypoxia, and irradiation by demonstrating that anti-miR-155 molecules also sensitize hypoxic lung cancer cells to irradiation. Our study helps explain how miR-155 becomes elevated in lung cancers, which contain extensive hypoxic microenvironments, and demonstrates that inhibition of miR-155 may have important therapeutic potential as a means to radiosensitize hypoxic lung cancer cells."

Furthermore, PU-PEI-miR145-treated GBM-CD133(+) effectively suppressed the expression of drug-resistance and anti-apoptotic genes and increased the sensitivity of the cells to radiation and temozolomide. Finally, the in vivo delivery of PU-PEI-miR145 alone significantly suppressed tumorigenesis with stemness, and synergistically improved the survival rate when used in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide in orthotopic GBM-CD133(+)-transplanted immunocompromised mice.

hsa-mir-155,Breast Neoplasms,"The relative expression of miR-155 was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in corresponding nontumor tissues. High miR-155 expression was correlated with higher tumor grade, advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis (P?=?0.012, 0.001, and 0.003, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the disease-free and overall survival rates of high miR-155 group were significantly lower than those of low miR-155 group (P?=?0.038 and 0.029, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that high miR-155 expression was a poor prognostic factor (P?=?0.009). Furthermore, antisense targeting miR-155 could inhibit growth, induce cell arrest in G(0) /G(1) phase, enhance apoptosis, and increase radiosensitivity in breast cancer cells."

Moreover, the gastric cancer risk especially elevated in older individuals (aged >60 years), males, nonsmokers, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-infected individuals (adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.38-5.13, P = 0.004; adjusted OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.10-3.27, P = 0.022; adjusted OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.12-3.35, P = 0.018; adjusted OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.08-3.10, P = 0.024, respectively).

hsa-mir-34b,Breast Neoplasms,"In this study, we identified one such estrogen down-regulated microRNA, miR-34b, as an onco-suppressor that targets cyclin D1 and JAG-1 (jagged 1) in a ER-positive/wild-type p53 breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) as well as in ovarian and endometrial cells, but not in ER-negative or mutant p53 breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MBA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-435). There is a negative association between ER and miR-34b expression levels in ER-positive breast cancer patients. Tet-on induction of miR-34b can cause inhibition of tumor growth and cell proliferation. Also, the overexpression of miR-34b inhibited ER-positive breast tumor growth in an orthotropic mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. Further validations indicated that estrogen inhibition of miR-34b expression was mediated by interactions between ER and p53, not by DNA methylation regulation. The xenoestrogens diethylstilbestrol and zeranol also showed similar estrogenic effects by inhibiting miR-34b expression and by restoring the protein levels of miR-34b targets, cyclin D1 and JAG-1, in MCF-7 cells."

Luciferase assay revealed that the rs2735383C allele had a lower transcription activity than G allele; and the hsa-miR-629 but not hsa-miR-499-5P had effect on modulation of NBS1 gene in vitro. We further observed that the X-ray radiation induced more chromatid breaks in lymphocyte cells from the carriers of rs2735383CC homozygote than those from the subjects with other genotypes (P = 0.0008). Our data suggested that the rs2735383G>C variation contributes to an increased risk of lung cancer by diminishing gene's expression through binding of microRNA-629 to the polymorphic site in the 3'-UTR of NBS1 gene."

Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed that the status of microRNA-21 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients. Antisense-mediated microRNA-21 inhibition could significantly suppress growth, increase apoptosis and enhance chemo- or radiosensitivity of human cutaneous melanoma cells by inducing the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

The superimposed stimulation of HCV translation by ectopic miR-122 works best during the G 0, G 1 and G 2/M phases but is lower during the S phase. However, the levels of Ago2 protein do not substantially change during cell cycle phases, indicating that other cellular factors involved in HCV translation stimulation by miR-122 may be differentially expressed in different cell cycle phases. Moreover, the levels of endogenously expressed miR-122 in Huh7 cells are lowest in the S phase, indicating that the predominant G 0/G 1 state of non-dividing hepatocytes in the liver facilitates high expression of the HCV genome and stimulation by miR-122, with yet unknown factors involved in the differential extent of stimulation by miR-122."

hsa-mir-200b,Endometrial Neoplasms,"Luciferase assays and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the miR-200b/200c/429 family recognized the MRE in the 3' UTR of AP-2伪 gene and negatively regulated the expression of endogenous AP-2伪 proteins. SNP rs1045385 A>C variation enhanced AP-2伪 expression by disrupting the binding of the miR-200b/200c/429 family to the 3' UTR of AP-2伪. The effects of the two polymorphic variants on cisplatin sensitivity were determined by clonogenic assay. The overexpression of AP-2伪 with mutant 3' UTR (C allele) in the endometrial cancer cell line HEC-1A, which has high levels of endogenous miR-200b/200c/429 and low levels of AP-2伪 protein, significantly increased cisplatin sensitivity, but overexpression of A allele of AP-2伪 has no significant effects, compared with mock transfection. We concluded that miR-200b/200c/429 induced cisplatin resistance by repressing AP-2伪 expression in endometrial cancer cells. The SNP (rs1045385) A>C variation decreased the binding of miR-200b/200c/429 to the 3' UTR of AP-2伪, which upregulated AP-2伪 protein expression and increased cisplatin sensitivity. Our results suggest that SNP (rs1045385) may be a potential prognostic marker for cisplatin treatment."
